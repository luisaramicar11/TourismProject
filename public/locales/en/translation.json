  "text1-largest-communities": "In a broad sense, the term indigenous (from Latin: indigĕna native, from indu- within, and genus born) applies to everything relative to a population native to the territory it inhabits, whose establishment in it precedes that of other ethnicities or whose presence is sufficiently prolonged and stable to be considered native (that is, originating from a place). With the same sense, the term native is used more frequently —often believed to be equivalent— present in expressions such as 'native language,' which is not exactly synonymous with indigenous, since in its correct meaning native means born in a territory whether or not their lineage is indigenous to it. It is also common to use terms like 'original peoples,' 'native nations,' or 'aboriginals.'"
